# CBB_Learning_Transfer

Repo for data and code pertaining to the project on the transfer of learned opponent models in zero sum games submitted to Computational Brain & Behavior. 

Manuscript and main analyses in "CBB/CBB_v2.Rmd". The manuscript also contains likelihood by trial code and HMM analysis for strategy switching. Supplementary information manuscript and analysis can de found in "CBB/CBB_SI.Rmd"

Non-BCH Computational models for experiment 1 (resp. 2) can be found in "Computational modelling/Experiment_1_modelling.Rmd" (resp. Experiment_2_modelling.Rmd).  BCH models for experiment 1 (resp. 2) can be found in "Computational modelling/Bayesian_models_exp1" (resp. "/Bayesian_models_exp2").
